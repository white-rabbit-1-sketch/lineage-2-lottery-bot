## Features

- **Automated Gameplay**: Simulates user interactions for lottery predictions.
- **Prediction Engine**: Analyzes past game data to predict future outcomes using trend analysis and machine learning models.
- **Dynamic Context Modeling**: Includes streak analysis, transition probabilities, and color distribution trends to refine predictions.
- **Extensive Logging**: Tracks wins, losses, and game patterns to improve bot accuracy over time.
- **File-Based Persistence**: Saves and merges game history for continuous learning.

## Warning

On my specific server, the lottery uses a fair random algorithm with an approximate ratio of 45-45-10 (red-black-zero), which makes predictions impossible, even with the use of a neural network. Therefore, this project is likely to be unusable on almost any L2 server unless you know the exact algorithm used as the RNG. In any case, it was a worthy attempt, so I kept the project for historical purposes â€” and perhaps it could be adapted for other goals in the future.
